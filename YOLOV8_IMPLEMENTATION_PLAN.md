# YOLOv8 Transportation Model Implementation Plan

## Overview
This branch explores replacing the current COCO-SSD model with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model specifically trained for transportation/traffic detection.

## Performance Comparison: Server-side vs Browser-side

### Server-side Processing (RECOMMENDED)

#### Advantages:
- **10-100x Faster**: GPU acceleration with CUDA/TensorRT
- **Better Accuracy**: Can use larger models (YOLOv8l, YOLOv8x)
- **Consistent Performance**: Not limited by client hardware
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple videos simultaneously
- **No Memory Constraints**: Handle large videos and models
- **Advanced Post-processing**: Complex tracking, analytics
- **Model Security**: Keep proprietary models private

#### Performance Metrics:
- **YOLOv8n**: ~200-500 FPS on RTX 3080
- **YOLOv8s**: ~150-300 FPS on RTX 3080
- **YOLOv8m**: ~100-200 FPS on RTX 3080
- **Memory**: 8-16GB GPU can handle multiple streams

### Browser-side Processing (CURRENT)

#### Limitations:
- **CPU/WebGL Only**: 5-15 FPS typical performance
- **Memory Constraints**: 2-4GB typical browser limit
- **Battery Drain**: High power consumption on mobile
- **Inconsistent Performance**: Varies by device/browser
- **Model Size Limits**: Must keep models small (<50MB)
- **CSP Issues**: Requires unsafe-eval for TensorFlow.js

#### Performance Metrics:
- **COCO-SSD**: ~10-20 FPS on decent hardware
- **YOLOv8n (ONNX)**: ~5-15 FPS expected
- **Memory**: Limited to browser sandbox

## Recommended Architecture: Hybrid Approach

### Option 1: Real-time Server Processing
```
Browser → Upload Video → Server (YOLOv8) → Stream Results → Live Visualization
```

### Option 2: Offline Processing with Results API
```
Upload Videos → Server Processing → Database → API → Web Dashboard
```

### Option 3: WebSocket Real-time
```
Browser Video Stream → WebSocket → Server YOLOv8 → WebSocket → Live Bounding Boxes
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Server-side YOLOv8 Service
1. **FastAPI Backend** with YOLOv8 inference
2. **Video Upload Endpoint** for processing
3. **WebSocket Support** for real-time streaming
4. **Results API** for processed data

### Phase 2: Web Interface Updates  
1. **Video Upload Component**
2. **Processing Status Display**
3. **Real-time Results Viewer**
4. **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard**

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
1. **TensorRT Optimization** for NVIDIA GPUs
2. **Multi-stream Processing**
3. **Result Caching**
4. **Load Balancing**

## Technical Requirements

### Server Infrastructure:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060+ or Tesla T4+
- **RAM**: 16GB+ system memory
- **VRAM**: 8GB+ GPU memory
- **Storage**: SSD for video processing
- **Framework**: PyTorch, FastAPI, OpenCV

### Model Specifications:
- **Input Size**: 640x640 (YOLOv8 standard)
- **Classes**: Transportation-specific (cars, trucks, buses, bikes, pedestrians, etc.)
- **Format**: PyTorch (.pt) or ONNX (.onnx)
- **Quantization**: INT8 for production deployment

## Development Plan

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. Set up Python backend with YOLOv8
2. Create video processing API endpoints
3. Test with sample NYC intersection videos
4. Benchmark performance vs current browser implementation
5. Design real-time streaming architecture

### Success Metrics:
- **Processing Speed**: >30 FPS for real-time analysis
- **Accuracy**: >95% precision on transportation objects
- **Latency**: <100ms for real-time streaming
- **Throughput**: Multiple concurrent video streams

## Files to Modify:
- `backend/` (new directory for server)
- `src/services/` (API integration)
- `src/components/VideoPlayer` (streaming support)
- `package.json` (new dependencies)

## Conclusion

**Server-side processing is strongly recommended** for production deployment due to:
- 10-100x performance improvement
- Better accuracy with larger models
- Consistent performance across users
- Ability to handle multiple video streams
- Professional-grade analytics capabilities

The browser-side implementation serves well as a proof-of-concept, but server-side processing is essential for real-world traffic monitoring applications.
